Sometimes, part of the bee families do not need checking\n            </li>\n            <li>\n            Decline in production, as a result of the intervention of the beekeeper, who unnecessarily disrupted the work process in the bee family. The recovery of bees' normal rhythm takes a few days\n            </li>\n            <li>Loss of bees. When checking a bee family, there is always a high risk of killing worker bees or inadvertently losing, or killing the bee mother. This will likely result in a delay in the bee family development, which is detrimental to the obtained production, especially during the honey harvesting period</li>\n            <li>Deterioration in the quality of honey and other bee products.
